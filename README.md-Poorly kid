Stretch
Kaidn Hdsn has forced my granchild, Stcy Brlw to stretch he muscles.
Stcy is 3 years old.
This has happened for a week now.
And after given chance after chance for him to stop, he has done no such thing resulting in this write up.
Childrens muscles are still growing whilst getting older, stretching at a young age can damage the muscles/Tendons, ligaments ect.
Kaidn knows this the reason why he is doing what he is doing ( Making) ( Forcing)
